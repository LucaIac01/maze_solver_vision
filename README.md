# 🧠 Maze Projects Collection

This repository contains two complementary Java/Python projects for working with mazes:

1. **Maze Generator** – A Python-based tool that creates customizable mazes as image files.
2. **Maze Solver Vision** – A Java + OpenCV project that detects and solves maze images.

Both projects are fully independent, but designed to work well together.

## 🔗 Subproject Overviews

### 🔨 [MazeGenerator](./MazeGenerator)

A Python script that generates mazes of any size (e.g. 20x15) and saves them as PNG files inside a dedicated folder.

- Input: Width, Height, Filename
- Output: PNG image in `maze_image/`
- No external dependencies except `Pillow`

### 🧭 [MazeSolver](./MazeSolver)

A Java project that uses OpenCV to detect the maze structure, find the shortest path (using BFS), and draw the result centered in the corridors.

- Input: PNG maze image (with start and exit marked in red)
- Output: Solved image with traced path
- Requires: Java + OpenCV 4.13

## 🤝 Integration Workflow

You can use the maze generated by the Python tool as input for the Java-based solver. Simply:

1. Generate a maze using `MazeGenerator`
2. Manually add the start and exit points
3. Run the solver from `MazeSolver` with the image path
